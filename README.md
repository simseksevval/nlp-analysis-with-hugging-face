* The first four files are exercises. They include an understanding basics of:
   * pipelines
   * sentiment analysis
   * text generation
   * translation
   * speech recognition
   * padding
   * transformers library with PyTorch and Tensorflow
* After the first four exercises, the following large-scale projects were carried out:
  * Sentiment Analysis (text classification) with PyTorch and Tensorflow
  * Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* The codes in this repo were made with the applications in Tirendaz Academy's "Deep Learning: Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Hugging Face" course on Udemy.
